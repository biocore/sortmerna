/*! @fn paralleltraversal()
	@brief Traverse the query input and indexed database and output
		   alignments passing the E-value threshold
	@detail The following methods will be executed:
	<ol>
	  <li> compute the gumbel parameters (lamda and K) using ALP,
		   load the index fully or in parts (depending on how
		   it was built) </li>
	  <li> using 3 intervals, scan over the read and collect all
		   L-mers on the read which match to the reference
		   index with at most 1 error. This is done using
		   parallel traversal between the index and the
		   Levenshtein automaton </li>
	  <li> if enough L-mers were collected, extend them into
		   longer matches using the Longest Increasing
		   subsequence (LIS) of positions where the L-mers
		   matched on the read and the associated reference
		   sequences </li>
	  <li> if the LIS is long enough, use the starting positions
		   of the LIS to estimate the starting position
		   of an alignment and pass this reference segment and
		   read to SSW </li>
	  <li> if the alignment score is at least the minimum score
		   corresponding to the E-value threshold, keep the read,
		   otherwise continue searching for other LIS or more
		   L-mers using smaller intervals </li>
	</ol>
